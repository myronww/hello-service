# Hello Service Repository

A simple service based on NGINX, GUnicorn, Flask and Flask-RestPlus with role based nginx configuration for installing multiple REST servers with different roles on a single server and versioning support in the rest service.

This is a base repository that I can base other rest service projects on.  It has a desirable code layout good for pip packaging and supports linting, code cleanup, deployment, and automated environment configuration.
